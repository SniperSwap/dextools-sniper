<p align="center">Sniper bot to buy and sell trending tokens on Dextools.</p>

## Getting Started
This bot automatically buys BSC tokens that are trending on Dextools. You can set take-profit and stop-loss percentage. Use at your own risk. Investing in cryptocurrency is risky. This is not financial advice. There is a small 1% buying fee per buy. This is to help me buy a cup of coffee and support for this project. 

## Requirements
- Windows 7 or older
- .NET framework 4.7.2 runtime
- RPCs for each network (ex. Infura)

## Usage
